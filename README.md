# MERN Stack Project: Build a Full Stack Restaurant Application

Sure, here's a revised version suitable for an internship level:

"This project is designed for beginners eager to learn the fundamentals of backend development and understand how to integrate backend functionality with their frontend projects. Even if you're familiar with the basics of backend development, this Project will also cover essential aspects like error handling. The project stack used is MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), making it an excellent starting point for gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development."
